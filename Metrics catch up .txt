Notes
* Audience - we will collect the data from the check ins 
* Not going to show the departments each others placings. 
* CDDO Leadership David Knott and Martin Bowyer would be interested in the whole picture
* Spend Controls - Dept seems to be a free entry field for submitters to put in what they want so email address is the only reliable way at the moment
* AL: Attaching the dept name to the email is something that Andrew can set up automatically. 
* AL: What are the blanks? WG: Where they haven’t returned. Is it useful to show the blanks? For the confidence it is useful in seeing that. SHould change in Sept 2024 when this becomes mandatory.
* AL: Pull out the return rate across depts as a visual and also the breakdown of the yes/no to show them how many are meeting the SbD. Maybe some sort of changeover time too - WG: yes
* No Tableau - use Google for Services stuff but not worth investing at the moment
* Other data - include Cost / End Date 
* Phase labels - what do the blanks mean? To be discussed with Spend- AL wil look at grouping them
* Will look at Spend, delivery phase and yes/no
* Does the summary slide need the All Depts info? WG has given graphs a go. 
*
